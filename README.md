For this task, I used **Python** along with the **spaCy** NLP library to build a simple chatbot capable of understanding and responding to basic user queries. The platform used was a standard Python development environment such as **VS Code** or **Google Colab**. From this task, I learned how Natural Language Processing tools like spaCy can be used to tokenize and understand user input, classify intents based on keywords, and generate human-like responses. It also reinforced how rule-based logic can power simple conversational agents even without complex machine learning models.
